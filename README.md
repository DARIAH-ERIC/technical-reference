# DARIAH Technical Reference

This is the technical reference for the DARIAH Infrastructure.
The documents contained in this repository are intended to form basic guidelines and references
for development and maintenance of infrastructure services with DARIAH and beyond.
They rely heavily on work by the community and in particular
[Cessda Eric](https://www.cessda.eu/), [CLARIAH-NL](https://www.clariah.nl/), [DARIAH-DE](https://de.dariah.eu/) as well as the
[Netherlands eScience Center](https://esciencecenter.nl/) and the [UK Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk).

To make use of these guides, implementing an institutional manunal based on this is recommended.
In many places, choices are pointed out but should be made for a specific manual.

It is particularly recommended to adopt the
[Recommendations to encourage best practices in research software](https://softdev4research.github.io/recommendations/)
whenever starting a new project.

## Contents

The reference currently contains

* [Developer Guidelines](developer-guidelines/01-basics.md)
* [Operational Guidelines](operational-guidelines/01-basics.md)
* [Quality Software Checklist](quality/software-checklist.md)
* and a [Glossary](glossary.md).

## Further reading

When starting a software project, consider using the
[Software Sustainbility Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk)'s
[Software Management Plan](https://www.software.ac.uk/software-management-plans).

This work relies heavily on the
[Netherlands eScience Center Guide](https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/) and the
[CLARIAH Software Quality Guidelines](https://github.com/CLARIAH/software-quality-guidelines).

## Development

The Technical Reference is still in early development.

Work on these documents is carried out within “DESIR – DARIAH ERIC Sustainability Refined” for [DARIAH ERIC](https://www.dariah.eu/).
This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020
research and innovation programme under grant agreement 731081.
