Code Hosting Policies
=====================

General Rules
-------------

Make sure to publish your code in a public repository.

-  There are a number of well-known commercial solutions, such as:

-  `GitHub <https://github.com/pricing>`__
-  `GitLab <https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-com/>`__
-  `Bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/product/pricing>`__

They all offer some free options and using them has a number of advantages, e.g.:

-  Good and established usability
-  High visibility of you code
-  Low barrier for find-ability and re-use
-  Good integration with other services and solutions

When using commercial and in particular external services you must have

-  There are a number of possibilities to host your own solution

-  The commercial solutions above.
-  `GitLab Community Edition <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org>`__
-  `Gogs <https://gogs.io/>`__
-  `Gitea <https://gitea.io/en-us/>`__
-  `gitolite <http://gitolite.com/gitolite/index.html>`__

Specific Solutions
------------------

On Site
~~~~~~~

-  Be sure to implement all relevant operational procedures.

GitHub
~~~~~~

When using GitHub, implementing a suitable policy is recommended.

Organisations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GitHub organisations can be used to group all repositories of an institution or a research project. It should be clearly stated who is
responsible for an organisation, ideally stated in the organisation's GitHub Page.

Always ensure rights are managed by a sufficient number of people:

-  | At least two people should be owner of the organisation.
   | It may be appropriate to have two owners from each institution involved in the project.

-  Create an institutional account. This account becomes owner of all organisations the institution is involved in and makes sure access is
   ensured from individual employees.

Organisations should have a policy on who can be a member and how repository maintainers and maintenance status are defined and
communicated.

Backup
^^^^^^

As GitHub is a commercial company, the service provided through GitHub is subject to change through corporate development. It is highly
recommended to set up an automated backup system, in order to ensure that a copy of all code and metadata (including issues, wikis etc.)
exists.

Features
^^^^^^^^

Use the features provided by GitHub, such as issue labels, issue and pull-request templates etc.
