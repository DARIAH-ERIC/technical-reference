Incidents and Postmortems
=========================

Record all outages including

-  Which service was *disrupted*?
-  What else was *affected*?
-  Who was *in charge* of the recovery?
-  *When* was the incident *discovered*?
-  *How* and *by whom*?
-  When has the incident *begun*?
-  When was the incident *mitigated*?
-  Who was *informed* and how?
-  Has this ever happened *before*?
-  Has *sensitive* data, such as user data or secrets, been compromised?

Particular importance should be applied to record all steps taken to mitigate the incident. These should include the person, time and
specifics of any action taken.

Security breaches and vulnerability exploits may need to be reported to authorities, in particular if sensitive and/or (legally)
protected data was (potentially) affected. Users must be informed appropriately, responsibly and quickly.

Finally, decide upon and implement measures to prevent repetitions.
