DARIAH Technical Reference
==========================

This is the technical reference for the DARIAH Infrastructure. The documents contained in this repository are intended to form basic
guidelines and references for development and maintenance of infrastructure services with DARIAH and beyond. They rely heavily on work by
the community and in particular `CESSDA ERIC <https://www.cessda.eu/>`__, `CLARIAH-NL <https://www.clariah.nl/>`__,
`DARIAH-DE <https://de.dariah.eu/>`__ as well as the `Netherlands eScience Center <https://esciencecenter.nl/>`__ and the `UK Software
Sustainability Institute <https://www.software.ac.uk>`__.

This work also relies on the `Netherlands eScience Center Guide <https://guide.esciencecenter.nl/>`__ and the `CLARIAH Software Quality
Guidelines <https://github.com/CLARIAH/software-quality-guidelines>`__.

To make use of these guides, implementing an institutional manual based on this is recommended. In many places, choices are pointed out but
should be made for a specific manual.

It is particularly recommended to adopt the `Recommendations to encourage best practices in research
software <https://softdev4research.github.io/recommendations/>`__ whenever starting a new project.
Also, consider using the `Software Sustainability Institute <https://www.software.ac.uk>`__'s `Software
Management Plan <https://www.software.ac.uk/software-management-plans>`__.
