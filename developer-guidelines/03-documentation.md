# Documentation

Documentation is fundamental to ensure usability and usefulness of the software.
It must be stored along the code, ideally in the repository's `docs` folder.

1. User documentation
   Include a documentation for end users, including e.g.
   * Examples
   * Tutorials
   * How-Tos
   * FAQs
   * Screencasts

1. Developer documentation
   Provides instructions for developers.

   * How to set up the environment.
   * Dependencies.
   * How to build the code.
   * How to package the code.


1. Inline code documentation
   * Always adhere to the language's standard. When in doubt follow the [Google Style Guides](https://google.github.io/styleguide/).
