Changelog
=========

1. Adopt a :doc:`release policy <../policies/releasing>`.

2. Maintain a manually curated `Changelog <https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/>`__.

   -  Use a ``CHANGELOG.md``, like :download:`ours <../CHANGELOG.md>`.
   -  Structure in a descending order by version with release date.
   -  Add all changes applied in that version.
   -  Have an *unreleased* section at the top for the next release.
